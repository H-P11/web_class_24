        This is my spooky story about four friends on Halloween night.

<p><p>Once upon a time, there was a hidden town deep in the woods, cloaked in mist that clung to the branches like ghostly fingers. At its heart stood Hollowvale Manor, an old mansion abandoned long ago. Locals kept their distance, saying the house was cursed and that strange figures could be seen flickering through its broken windows. Some claimed to hear faint cries at night, drifting on the wind.</p>

<p>On Halloween night, four friends dared each other to explore the place. They met at midnight, carrying flashlights and a single, trembling candle. As they pushed open the wrought-iron gate, a chill seeped into their bones. The mansion loomed before them, its tall, narrow windows dark like hollow eyes. Above them, crows stirred, watching silently from the trees.</p>

<p>Inside, the floor was thick with dust, and every step left a trail of prints that seemed to vanish when they turned away. Long-forgotten furniture lay under decaying sheets, and faded portraits lined the walls—faces that seemed to stare, unblinking, at the newcomers. They moved deeper into the house, their voices low, their footsteps muffled as if the darkness were swallowing up all sound.</p>

<p>Then, they heard it—a faint, rhythmic tapping from the floor above them, as if something was being dragged, slowly but deliberately. They climbed the grand staircase, hearts hammering in their chests, and found themselves at the entrance of a long hallway. A faint glow was coming from a room at the end, flickering like candlelight.</p>

<p>They crept forward, and as they neared, the door swung open by itself, revealing a dusty parlor, with a tall mirror dominating one wall. A single, pale figure was reflected in it—a woman with long, matted hair, her face half-hidden in shadows. Her mouth moved, forming words they couldn’t hear, her hand outstretched as if beckoning them closer.</p>

<p>One of the friends, unable to resist, took a step forward. His friends tried to hold him back, but it was as if he were in a trance, his gaze locked onto the figure’s dark, hollow eyes. He reached out, fingertips touching the cold glass…and then, with a snap, he disappeared. The mirror rippled like water, and the woman’s hand closed over his, pulling him into the shadowy depths.</p>

<p>Panic surged through the others as they stumbled backward, tripping over the furniture, desperate to escape. But as they raced down the hall, the portraits on the walls seemed to come alive. The painted faces twisted into expressions of horror, mouths open in silent screams. They tried to run, but the hallway seemed to stretch on forever, looping endlessly, the tapping sound following close behind them.</p>

<p>Finally, they burst through the front door, gasping as they reached the outside air. But one of them, the friend who had touched the mirror, was gone—vanished without a trace. When they looked back at the house, the front door had already shut tight, and a new portrait had appeared on the wall: their friend, now frozen in paint, a look of horror on his face.</p>

<p>Legend says that anyone who dares to enter Hollowvale Manor will find the missing friend’s face in the gallery of portraits. And if you listen closely, just after midnight, you can hear the faint tapping of his fingers from inside the mirror, calling for someone else to take his place.</p>
